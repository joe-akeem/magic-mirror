# magic-mirror

Face recognition on raspberry pi with raspberry pi camera module.
The program runs in two phases. Phase one: training, phase two: face recognition. Just follow the prompts one the
command line or the  voice prompts (if connected to a speaker).
Can be run in headless mode e.g. when started from a remote shell. To do that just run the program with an
arbitrary parameter. When run in normal mode, the program will display the frames captured from camera as well
as the detected faces.
